Requirements:

1.	Secure S3 bucket in same region as ec2 instance. Two sub-folders should be created there: data and code
2.	Host with git
3.	Admin level access to an AWS account

Steps:
1.	Git clone the repo and branch (https://github.nike.com/CIS/winning-team-gitops/tree/topic/flaskstuff)
2.	Create or post server TLS/SSL server certs as server_cert.pem and server_key.pem in the ./servercerts sub-folder
a.	Option 1: Generate self signed (use chmod +x generate_self_signed.sh && ./generate_self_signed.sh)
b.	Option 2: Get from venafi
3.	Zip up all files and folders (excluding *.log and us-west-2.ec2.run-flask-v1.yaml) to a file named “mlai.zip”
a.	Note: Do not zip root folder, rather, the files and sub folders
4.	Post the zip file to the s3 bucket /code folder
5.	Login to destination AWS account, go to cloud formation, and create a new stack using us-west-2.ec2.run-flask-v1.yaml

Notes, 
1.	Once the CF script completes, the server has about 5 minutes of work to process.  
2.	The CF script in the output tab will list items it created as well as provide a cut and paste text string for SSH to new host.
3.	To monitor progress of server build activity, ssh to the host, and then issue tail -f /var/log/user-data.log.  This will show retime the execution.
4.	Once all server setup steps are completed, the host will reboot
5.	The CF script outputs the url (in output tab) to the host
6.	Web requests / crashes, etc are recorded in /processor/mlai/app.log.  You can ssh to host and run tail -f /processor/mlai/app.log to monitor it
7.	The CF script generates the /processor/mlai/.env file that configures things like data path, etc.  Check that if issues arise
